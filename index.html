                    <p> Hello world! My name is John Cabuguason and I'm an aspiring software engineering student 
                    based in Toronto, ON.</p>
                    <p>I love honing new skills that I can use to further my education.  My goal is to bring innovative ideas
                    and creativity to the tech industry.I taught myself web development using online resources
                    in order to create this platform and broaden my skill set. Aside from web development I know multiple coding languages 
                    that I sharpen on a daily basis. </p>
